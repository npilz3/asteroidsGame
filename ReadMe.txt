For the images and movement, the previous homework, Homework5, was utilized. Classes
such as AnimatedGameObjects and RegularGameObjects were used to create the asteroids,
spaceship, and lasers. The movement keys were taken from the skeleton code of Homework5.


For sounds, playing them came from utilizing code found online, provided below:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22253074/how-to-play-or-open-mp3-or-wav-sound-file-in-c-program
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1565439/how-to-playsound-in-c-using-windows-api
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12980801/playsound-in-c-beeps-but-does-not-play-wav-file

These files allowed us to play .wav files for our game when we fired lasers and for
playing the background music.


For threads, information about calling methods of classes with threads came from this page:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10998780/stdthread-calling-method-of-class

This allowed us to use multiple threads at the same time during our game, letting us do
things like play music while updating images and animation.


We used the following site to help make the screens, which satisfies our inheritance requirements:

For our font, we utilized one called Endless Boss Battles, taken from this website:
